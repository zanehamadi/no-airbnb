A galactic airbnb clone, where you can search, rent and review planets.

## Technologies used:

- Redux
- Express
- React Calenders
- Node.js
- Heroku
- Git
- Github

## Features:

### Search

Users can search for planets through planet names, planetray systems, or temperature.

### Reviews

Users can post a review on planets that they have visited, and later edit or delete those reviews.

### Rating

Users can give a planet a star rating to a planet, and also update that rating or delete it.

### Booking

Users can book a planet, and other users are then restricted from booking that date.

## Challenges 

Dealing with collisions on booking dates was a definitely a tough thing to tackle, but with the React Calender, the logic was aided very smoothly. Definitely checkout that calender when you get the chance! https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar
